                 We are just two lifelong mates from the North East of England who were fed up with the state of the collectible games market. Like many fans, we struggled to find stock of their favourite trading cards and gaming products - constantly beaten to the punch by bots, resellers, and scalpers. What began as frustration turned into action: they created a platform with one clear goal - make collectibles accessible again.
            </p>

            <p class="my-4">
                At its core, Two Marras is an affiliate-based company built on fairness, transparency, and a deep love for the hobby. We monitor stock across multiple platforms so collectors don't have to. Our mission is simple: help real fans get the products they want, without the stress, the FOMO, or the exploitative pricing.  We're not here to play the scalpers' game... we're here to beat it.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Community is everything to us. We don't just serve collectors... we are collectors. That's why we're committed to putting people before profit, sharing real-time restock updates, and championing ethical access. No bots. No gatekeeping. Just two marras doing right by the community.
            </p>
